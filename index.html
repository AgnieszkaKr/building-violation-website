                <h3>You will never again rent an apartment with a broken smoke detector...</h3>
                Can you imagine signing a contract for a long-term rental of your dream apartment? It’s summer, and you are excited that
                your future place is comfortable, it’s so nice to work from home! Everything seems perfect…. You sign a contract, pay
                for the moving company and make the apartment your new place. Finally, you feel at home. Then winter is coming and you
                realize that the bedroom window can't be closed properly. The heating system works however temperature in the apartment
                is under 68 Fahrenheit degrees. Sounds like a nightmare…
                There is a solution for minimizing the risk of renting an apartment with unexpected issues.

                The New York City Housing Maintenance Code establishes the minimum standards for health and safety, fire protection,
                light, and ventilation cleanliness, repair and maintenance, and occupancy in residential dwellings. In accordance with
                the Code, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) issues violations against conditions, in rental
                dwelling units and buildings, that have been verified to violate the New York City Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) or the
                New York State Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL). Violations are registered by Housing Inspectors after a physical inspection
                of a building. (except for class I violations which are generally administratively issued). Violations are categorized
                into four classes:
                
                I violations which are generally administratively issued). Violations are categorized into four classes:
                <ul>
                    <li>A (non-hazardous),</li>
                    <li>Class B (hazardous),</li>
                    <li>Class C (immediately hazardous),</li>
                    <li>Class I (information orders).</li>
                </ul>
                You can search for information by violation id or a property address.
